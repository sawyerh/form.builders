This is a major work in progress and will look pretty empty for awhile. You [can follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FormBuilders) to hear when topics are added or updated.

This site is for people who design and build web forms. Specifically, this site is written from the perspective of working in civic tech. Oftentimes these are complex forms with less-than-ideal requirements and constraints. Hopefully what you find here helps you move quicker and better anticipate challenges.

Here you'll find resources, patterns and approaches for delivering a decent form experience. Some more proven than others. If you can, [contribute your learnings back to the site](/contributing).
