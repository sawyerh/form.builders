This site is for people who design and build digital forms. Specifically, this site is written from the perspective of people designing and building digital forms in civic tech. Oftentimes these are complex forms with less-than-ideal requirements and constraints. Hopefully what you find here helps you move quicker, enabling you to focus on the challenging aspects unique to your project, instead of reinventing wheels.

Here you'll find common patterns and approaches to delivering a "good" form experience. There's no single right way to design or build a form, because each use case and audience is different. What you'll find here are ideas and suggestions â€” it's up to you to continue to evolve these. If you can, contribute your learnings back to the site.
