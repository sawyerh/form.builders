Specifically, this site is written from the perspective of working in civic tech. Oftentimes these are complex forms with less-than-ideal requirements and constraints. Hopefully what you find here helps you move quicker, better anticipate challenges, and enables you to focus on the challenging aspects unique to your project, instead of reinventing wheels.","sidebar":"docs"},"integrating":{"id":"integrating","title":"System integration","description":"How you design and build your form is greatly influenced by the systems it needs to integrate with. If you don\'t have freedom to change those systems, then they often dictate aspects like business and validation rules, and can constrain the functionality and flow of your form experience. That\'s why it\'s important to understand the downstream system constraints early in your process, otherwise you may lose valuable time designing and building towards an experience that isn\'t feasible.","sidebar":"docs"},"scratchpad":{"id":"scratchpad","title":"Scratchpad","description":"Other topics I\'d like to write about:","sidebar":"docs"}}}')}}]);
